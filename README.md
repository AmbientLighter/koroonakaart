# Work in progress
This is a work in progress and was built in ~24 hours as part of the Hack the Crisis hackathon put on by Garage 48 in Estonia. It is developed by @neuroactive, @PuuraJ, and @Keeganmcbride. Data is crowdsourced from press releases and media reports. Please feel free to fork and/or PR. We hope to keep this up-to-date and improve over time. All suggestions and ideas are welcome.
